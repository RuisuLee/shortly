## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

### How to run

    git clone
    npm i
    npm run dev

The app will run on http://127.0.0.1:5173/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Effector](https://effector.dev/) - State manager

### Continued development

- Use real API instead of mock api calls
- Make session feature to store users shorted links
- Add routing between remaining links
